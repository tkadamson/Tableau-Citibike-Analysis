Visualizations for this project can be viewed in Tableau Public here: https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeAnalysis_16207656330520/FullCitibikeAnalysis?:language=en&:useGuest=true&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link

The landing page is the storyboard presentation for all data. Also included are two dashboards: one on ridership based on sex (Metrics on Sex), and one on ridership based on age (Metrics on Age). Lastly, there is a sheet containing a map of all ridership over the defined time period (Station Map by total Ridership).

## Citibike Analysis

The analysis is divded into five sections:
* Overview
* Ridership by Starting Station
* Ridership by Sex
* Ridership by Age
* Data Constraints

### Overview
Citibike is New York City's rideshare program sponsored by CitiBank. Riders have the option to either pay a monthly membership for unlimited rides or pay for each ride individually. For point of service purchases, there is a flat rate for the first 30 minutes and then a small per minute increate after the first thirty. Riders can end at any station they wish rather than returning the bike to its original location.

For the time period analyzed, January 2020 to April 2021, ridership clearly suffered a dramatic decline during the COVID-19 lockdown in New York City, dropping about 75% between March 11, 2020 and March 31, 2020. However, ridership mostly rebounded by summer, and then entered it's presumable decline over the winter months. 

In January 2021, there was a noticable increase in ridership which then dips agin in February. This may be due to an unseasonably warm January, with temperatures dipping again the next month. As winter has transitioned into spring 2021, ridership has rebounded. 

### Ridership by Location

Four out of the five New York City boroughs have Citibike stations. Manhattan has stations throughout the island, while stations in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx are generally concentrated closer to Manhattan and do not extend fully into those boroughs. 

South and midtown Manhattan have the highest ridership levels, with some stations exceeding 50,000 rides over the entire time period analyzed. While not all the stations in those areas are heavility used, the concentration of heavily used stations is greatest there. 

Outside Manhattan, the most popular stations are consentrated by the Brooklyn and Williamsburg Bridges, suggesting that there is a significant number across those bridges into Manhattan. After those hotspots, ridership tends to decrease into the low thousands or even hundreds as you go further into the outer boroughs. 

Overall, Manhattan is the clear location for most riders, even though it has a lower population than the other boroughs. This trend holds for both customers and subscribers. The reasoning behind the concentration behind these two groups may be different, however. For subscribers, most likely to be local users, a high concentration in Manhattan may be beccause Citibike is used more as a commuting tool than for leisure, as many people work in Manhattan and live in outer boroughs or suburbs. For customers, the logic may be that Manhattan is the largest borough for tourism (Times Square, Madison Square Garden, etc) and so Citibike may be a draw for tourists. More data is needed to determine the breakdown in ridership purpose between these groups.
